Days 1-10 complete in python

Written in python 3.9.7, deps so far only numpy.

Run any file in /src from the commandline with "python dayX.py" to get the results. Data should go in /data/dayXtest.txt (example) and /data/dayXinput.txt (actual input) or else change the hardcoded locations accordingly.
